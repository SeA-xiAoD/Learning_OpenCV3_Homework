The aim is to find a pupil. I come up with some ideas about this problem. I think logPolar is a good choice due to invariant representations of boject views by shifting the transformed image's center. But I have now idea currently how to define the logPolar shape is corresponding to a pupil's shape.

First Fourier and then logPolar? I'm not sure.

I'm not sure how to record a real object edge for inpainting mask. (If edge detection algorithm works? But how to draw on that?)

The histogram equalization is to map one distribution to anothor distribution which makes new image have wider and uniform distribution. The denoising is to eliminate some outliers of a image and do not change other pixels.
