I think the Ex_d is unreasonable, because the display is single channel and connot display colorful image. So the framework of the Ex_d and other exercises is different.

  The question a, b, c, d are quite easy, but the question e is worthy for consideration. My method is just like we calculus we learned. The sum of 45Â° rectangle can be seen as sum of many vertical straight lines. And the staright line is pixel presentation on computer screen so that it can also be seen as a rectangle to calculate the sum of pixels using the way of question d.  
  A little flaw of the code of question d, e is I didn't provide a judgement of the coordinate that user input. It is better to provide a function to control up is little than down and left is little than right.
