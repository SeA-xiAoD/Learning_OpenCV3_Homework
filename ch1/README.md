1. No depth information of the 3D space. We can use depth camera such as Kinect.  
2. Different view point will get very dissimliar images. Maybe we need more camera for more view point to get different information.
3. No position information of the 3D space. We also need more camera to get more information for key-point matching, so we can obtain the position of each object.
